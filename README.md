# HYPERLAUNCH-FINAL-PROJECT
# Student Depression Data Analysis Application

This project is a data-driven application built using Python to explore and analyze depression indicators among students. It includes preprocessing, visualizations, machine learning modeling, and an interactive CLI for user exploration. The goal is to uncover patterns and predict mental health outcomes based on student attributes.

## Features

- Loads and processes student mental health data (CSV format)
- Cleans missing values and handles outliers
- Performs univariate and bivariate statistical analysis
- Trains a classification model to predict depression levels or likelihood
- Visualizes trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Offers a command-line interface (CLI) for interactive user engagement

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` notebook file.
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Follow the notebook sections to:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
   - Train and test a machine learning model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Use the CLI to explore results and metrics

---

## Model Used

- **Logistic Regression** (or whichever model you used — feel free to modify)
  
### Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Visualizations

- Bar plot of depression indicators by gender
- Boxplot of CGPA across stress levels
- Histogram of sleep duration
- Correlation heatmap
- Confusion matrix plot

---

## User Interaction

The CLI allows users to:
- View basic dataset statistics
- Select visualizations to explore
- Run predictions using trained models
- View evaluation metrics

---

## Project Objective

To analyze student data for depression patterns and build a basic predictive pipeline that can assist in identifying mental health risks among students. The project combines data science techniques with machine learning and aims to create awareness through visualization and modeling.
